# Day-Trip-Generator

This is a project I put together for fun designed to help vacationers decided where and how to spend their off days. It was inspired by one of my favorite games called Fallout 4. It is a fun application for people who want to travel and have some fun instead of spending their weekend at home, simply follow the prompts and the Day Trip Generator will do the rest! It will give options for beautiful places to visit, great restaurants to eat at, safe modes of transportation and fun entertainment options!

Give it a try and let the Day Trip Generator plan your next adventure! Below are the guidelines for the project.

1. As a developer, make lists of:
    At least 3 Destinations (Goodneighbor, Diamond City, Sanctuary Hills)
    At least 3 Restaurants (Slocum Joe's, Cambridge Campus Diner, Power Noodles)
    At least 3 Transportations (Fast Travel, Vertibird, Power Armor)
    At least 3 Entertainments (Starlight Drive-In, Dugout Inn, Museum of Witchcraft)

2. As a developer, I want to store my final day trip selections in a Dictionary, with a unique key value pair for each piece of my day trip.

3. As a user, I want:
    A Destination to be randomly selected for my day trip.
    A Restaurant to be randomly selected for my day trip.
    A Transportation to be randomly selected for my day trip.
    A Entertainment to be randomly selected for my day trip.

4. As a user, I want to be able to randomly re-select a destination, restaurant, mode of transportation, and/or form of entertainment if I don't like one or more of those things.

5. As a user, I want to be able to confirm (Y/N) that my day trip is "Complete" once I like all of the random selections.

6. As a user, I want to display my completed trip in the console if (Yes) is selected. 

7. As a user, I want to restart the application if (No) is selected.
    
8. As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function shouold do just one thing.
