Looking at my "main.py" file...

# ---------------------------- CHECK ---------------------------- 
-As a developer, I want to store my final day trip selections in a Dictionary, with a unique key value pair for each 
piece of my day trip.

# ---------------------------- CHECK ---------------------------- 
-As a user, I want to be able to confirm (Y/N) that my day trip is "Complete" once I like all of the random selections.
    -As a user, I want to display my completed trip in the console if (Yes) is selected. 

# ---------------------------- CHECK ---------------------------- 
-As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function shouold do just 
one thing!
