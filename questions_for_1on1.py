Looking at my "scratch_paper.py" file...

Can you point me in the right direction to figure out how to do this? Because I'm not sure what to do.
    -As a developer, I want to store my final day trip selections in a Dictionary, with a unique key value pair for each 
        piece of my day trip.

Can you point me in the right direction to figure out how to do this? Because I'm not sure what to do.
-As a user, I want to be able to confirm (Y/N) that my day trip is "Complete" once I like all of the random selections.
    -As a user, I want to display my completed trip in the console if (Yes) is selected. 
    -As a user, I want to restart the application if (No) is selected.

Can you tell me if I'm doing a good job with this?
    -As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function shouold do just 
        one thing!
